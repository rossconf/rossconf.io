Ruby Open Source Software Vienna
=========
Ruby Open Source Software Vienna ([ROSSConf Vienna](http://rossconf.io)) is a one day conference bringing Open Source software maintainers and developers with a heart for outstanding and free software together in one room. Or multiple rooms, if need be.  

Five maintainers or main contributors to major Open Source projects will get the chance to recruit highly motivated developers to contribute to their project during the hackathon part of the conference.

ROSSConf Vienna is a local chapter of ROSSConf. All ROSSConf material and resources are [available in their own repo](https://github.com/rossconf/organizers-toolkit), for anyone to use and organize their own local chapter. The logo is an [Open Source project on its own](https://github.com/rossconf/logo/blob/master/README.md). And the website can be found at http://www.rossconf.io.
